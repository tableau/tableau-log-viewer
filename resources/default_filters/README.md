# Saved Filters

Share your filters with other users and give better default options to new users. The json files in the filters folder will be copied into the saved filter location and accessed from the Load Filters menu.

### How To Install Filters
On Windows, run the `install_all.bat` batch script. On Mac, run the `install_all.sh` script.

### Submit your own filter
To submit a filter of your own, find the filter in the ` %LOCALAPPDATA%\Tableau\TLV\filters\`  folder on windows and `~/Library/Preferences/Tableau/TLV/filters` on Mac. Copy that filter json file into the `./default_filters/filters` folder and submit a pull request to github.
